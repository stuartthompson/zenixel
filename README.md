# Zen2DLib
A simple 2D library based upon SDL that can be used to draw 2D graphics to the screen.

The purpose of this project is to learn more about static libraries in C++ and to build for myself a simple 2D graphics library that I can use in other projects requiring simple graphics capabilities.
